# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Python script that generates realistic-sounding random domain names. The script should produce domain names that appear authentic and cover a wide variety of top-level domains (TLDs) while including common subdomain patterns. This tool would be useful for testing, development, security research, or educational purposes where realistic domain name datasets are needed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate realistic-sounding domain names, so that I can create test datasets that closely resemble real-world domain patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system SHALL generate domain names that sound like real business or organization names
2. WHEN generating domain names THEN the system SHALL use realistic word combinations and patterns
3. WHEN creating domain names THEN the system SHALL avoid obviously fake or nonsensical combinations
4. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL produce domain names that could plausibly exist in the real world

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the script to support many different TLDs, so that the generated domains reflect the diversity of the modern internet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating domains THEN the system SHALL include common TLDs like .com, .org, .net
2. WHEN creating domains THEN the system SHALL include country-code TLDs like .de, .uk, .ca
3. WHEN generating domains THEN the system SHALL include newer generic TLDs like .tech, .shop, .app
4. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL randomly select from at least 50 different TLDs
5. WHEN selecting TLDs THEN the system SHALL weight common TLDs more heavily than rare ones

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the script to include standard subdomains, so that the generated domains reflect common web architecture patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating domains THEN the system SHALL include common subdomains like www, mail, ftp
2. WHEN creating subdomains THEN the system SHALL include technical subdomains like api, cdn, admin
3. WHEN generating domains THEN the system SHALL include service-specific subdomains like blog, shop, support
4. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL randomly decide whether to include a subdomain or not
5. WHEN including subdomains THEN the system SHALL select from at least 20 different subdomain options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control the number of domains generated, so that I can create datasets of the appropriate size for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the script THEN the system SHALL accept a command-line argument for the number of domains to generate
2. WHEN no count is specified THEN the system SHALL default to generating 10 domains
3. WHEN a count is provided THEN the system SHALL generate exactly that number of domains
4. WHEN the count is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error message and exit gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the generated domains to be output in a useful format, so that I can easily use them in my projects or tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN domains are generated THEN the system SHALL output each domain on a separate line
2. WHEN the script completes THEN the system SHALL display the total number of domains generated
3. WHEN generating domains THEN the system SHALL ensure no duplicate domains are produced in a single run
4. WHEN outputting domains THEN the system SHALL use proper domain name formatting (lowercase, valid characters)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the script to use realistic word sources, so that the generated domain names sound authentic and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating domain names THEN the system SHALL use common English words as base components
2. WHEN creating business names THEN the system SHALL combine words in patterns typical of real companies
3. WHEN generating names THEN the system SHALL include common business suffixes like "tech", "solutions", "group"
4. WHEN creating domains THEN the system SHALL use word combinations that make semantic sense together
5. WHEN the script initializes THEN the system SHALL load word lists for different categories (nouns, adjectives, business terms)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the script to generate international domain names with special characters, so that the domains reflect the global nature of the internet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating domains for certain country-code TLDs THEN the system SHALL include domains with international characters (like German äöüß)
2. WHEN creating international domains THEN the system SHALL use appropriate character sets for the corresponding country/language
3. WHEN generating German domains THEN the system SHALL include words with umlauts (ä, ö, ü) and eszett (ß)
4. WHEN outputting international domains THEN the system SHALL properly encode them using punycode format
5. WHEN including international characters THEN the system SHALL ensure the domains are valid according to IDN standards
